hi! i guess this is going to be the typical "oh wow this is what i did in 2024" blog post. this year had so many lows and a few high-highs for me, so i want to think for a bit on those good things and just share some of the things i learned, found out or just liked throughout the year :)

## things that happened

- i learned Go, somewhat. 
  - Go is a language i had been wanting to learn for a while and while i haven't done some big project with it, i've *tried* to make some tiny APIs to do stuff quickly, like [webhookserver](https://github.com/rdcsq/webhookserver), which i made to automatically deploy stuff to my VPS from a GitHub Action without giving it SSH access or setting something like [Coolify](https://coolify.io)
- i got my first software development job! i started on Android app dev (with Kotlin) and then switched to full-stack web development (with C# + Vue).
- i got my dream computer
  - i got a macbook pro (m3 pro, 512/18gb) after my previous one (a Lenovo Ideapad 5 15ITL05) decided to give up on its hinges, completely (i had already fixed one of the hinges but the other one gave up mid-class and after fixing it as well, i just didn't trust it anymore. it is now a home server).
  - not gonna lie, i feel cringe calling it a "dream computer" but oh well.
